# gale-shapley-algorithm
This code is implementing the Stable Marriage Problem and measuring the runtime of the algorithm for different input sizes. The Stable Marriage Problem involves finding a stable matching between two equally sized sets of elements, typically referred to as "men" and "women", based on their preferences for each other. A matching is considered stable if there are no two elements who prefer each other over their current partners.

The code starts by importing several modules including NumPy and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization, respectively. It then defines a function "inputFnc" to generate random preferences for men and women, a function "wPrefersM1OverM" to determine whether a woman prefers one man over another, and a function "stableMarriage" to implement the stable marriage algorithm.

The main part of the code involves a loop that runs the stable marriage algorithm for different input sizes specified by the user. It generates random preferences using the inputFnc function, runs the stable marriage algorithm using the stableMarriage function, and measures the runtime of the algorithm using the time module. The runtime for each input size is appended to a list called "runtimee", and the corresponding input size is appended to a list called "iterations". Finally, the code plots a line graph of the runtime versus the input size using Matplotlib.
